### ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I'm a software developer who loves the variety that comes with the the work. When I'm not debugging or refactoring, you'll find me canoing, gardening, or tinkering with whatever catches my curiosity.

I'm passionate about creating inclusive workplaces where thoughtful communication amplifies marginalized voices. Code is just one way we can build better communities.

What I'm up to:
- Writing about development at [enumerator.dev](https://enumerator.dev)
- Building [willow.camp](https://willow.camp), a blogging platform
- Making banking better at [Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/)
