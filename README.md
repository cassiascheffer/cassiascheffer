### Hi there 👋

I am a software developer, canoeist, gardener and and all-round tinkerer. I got into software because of my curiosity about how things work. I kept asking “why” until I eventually found myself doing it for a job. I love the range of work I get to do as an engineer.

My work often focuses on performance improvements and coaching teams in code design choices. I value thoughtful communication that amplifies marginalized voices in the workplace.
