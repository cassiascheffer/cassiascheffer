### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer, canoeist, gardener and and all-round tinkerer. I love the range of work I get to do as a developer.

My work often focuses on performance improvements and coaching teams in code design choices. I value thoughtful communication that amplifies marginalized voices in the workplace.
